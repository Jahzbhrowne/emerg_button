		Emerg_button

This project is a system that makes use of the raspberry pi and a button.
It is made for high security companies like banks, investment companies, schools among others.
The main purpose of this system is to provide just in time (JIT) intervention in emergency cases. 
Usually, such emergencies escalate before help comes in. so this sysytem is to ensure that a situation can be salvaged and controlled before it gets out of hand.
For instance, in cases of fire, the fire button is pressed as soon as the fire alarm sounds, and then a notification containing the exact location of the fire is sent to the fire service for just in time intervention.
It would be designed in such a way that when pressed,it sends a notification which specifies the exact location and the numbers of hours or minutes it will take to reach the emergency point, to the particular institution appropriate for the specific emergency.
